This is a small program to maintain consistent folder structures for
all my side projects. This is inspired by this [blog post](http://enetdown.org/outgoing/posts/2016/06/19/code-cultivation-to-software-engineering/)

To do: 

- Run a check on the top folder (`projects`) for inconsistent folder
  structure, missing GitHub repos, and report if there is any error.
