# projmgt

This is a small program to maintain consistent folder structures for
all my side projects. This is inspired by this [blog post](http://enetdown.org/outgoing/posts/2016/06/19/code-cultivation-to-software-engineering/)

Features (plan):

- Create a new project by asking for: name of the project, the github
repo, other folders needed (notes, reading, docs, etc.)

- Run a check on the top folder (`projects`) for inconsistent folder
  structure, missing GitHub repos,  Report if there is any error.
